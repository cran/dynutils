dynutils 1.0.1 (2018-01-03)

 * DOCUMENTATION: Fixed functionality vignette not showing any code.

 * FUNCTIONALITY: Add `mapdf_lat()`. This function expects a data frame,
   which gets broken down into a list of lists before applying the FUN.
   It expects the FUN to return a list, which gets transformed into a tibble
   with `list_as_tibble()`.

 * FUNCTIONALITY: `extract_row_to_list()` now works with tidy evaluation.

 * TESTING: Expand tests for tibble helper fuctions `list_as_tibble()` and
   `extract_row_to_list()`.

 * FUNCTIONALITY: Add `safe_tempdir()` function. This function creates a
   unique temporary directory and creates it if necessary.
   
 * FUNCTIONALITY: Add helper assertion functions 
   `%all_in%`, `%has_names%`, `is_bounded()` and `is_single_numeric()`.
